## How To Help: The To Do List ##
Proofread everything looking for typos. In the LXX2012 we additionally need to look for archaic words and old names that need to be updated. Some of it can be search and replace, for others we will need to examine each instance to make sure it makes sense in the context. 

Update the Agenda.ods file with your progress when you commit. For example, if you're proofreading Genesis in the LXX2012, next to the Genesis row on the LXX2012 tab you could put "1-9:6" to indicate it has been proofread from chapter 1 to chapter 9 verse 6. Then next time you (or someone else) can pick up at chapter 9 verse 7 and begin proofreading. When reaching a stopping place and are ready to commit, update that cell in Agenda.ods before committing. Commit often.

After we have updated both the Greek and English for a book, we will break that book out into its own file with one column for English, one column for Greek, and formatting. The current Genesis and Exodus files are examples of this, but do not contain proofread text.
